I'm currently migrating my blog from Tumblr to Mixture and the new collections feature. This is currently a work in progress project that I'm pushing chnages to daily.

### Notes:

1. In this project I have set "useNodeSass" to true as I am only using basic Sass functionality and it means the project benefits from instant compilation, you can set this to false and use the standard process if you wish.
2. The project uses js for paging (load more), but if you disable this standard paging is implemented.
3. I put together a quick script to migrate my Tumblr blog to the correct Mixture format - [you can get that from Github](https://github.com/teammixture/tumblr-mixture).
