# Blog [neilkinnish.com](http://neilkinnish.com)

Migrated my blog from Tumblr to Mixture (using the [collections](http://docs.mixture.io/collections) feature).

### Notes

1. In this project I am using Sass, but I have set "useNodeSass" to true as I am only using basic Sass functionality and it means the project benefits from instant compilation, you can set this to false and use the standard process if you wish.
2. The project uses js for paging (load more), but if you disable this then standard paging is implemented.

### Migration script

I put together a quick script to migrate my Tumblr blog to the correct Mixture format - [you can get it from Github](https://github.com/teammixture/tumblr-mixture).
