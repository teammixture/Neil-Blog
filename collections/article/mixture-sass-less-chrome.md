Over the last few weeks we&#8217;ve been actively using Mixture on real projects, it&#8217;s fantastic as it not only allows us to find and fix bugs but also helps us improve the user experience and dream up new features that we think will aid the users development process and workflow. It&#8217;s also a great feeling to use a tool you&#8217;re building that really quenches a thirst.

Although not a new concept, we wanted to improve the process of debugging and inspecting a page with the browser when using preprocessors such as Sass or Less.

So we&#8217;ve created a small chrome extension that works with the developer tools, specifically the elements inspector. Selecting an element will show you the styles for that selection, each with a link to the original Sass/Less file and line number, clicking a link will talk to Mixture and open the file in your default IDE / Editor.

We&#8217;ll be releasing Mixture for preview very soon! for updates please follow @[TeamMixture](http://twitter.com/teammixture).
