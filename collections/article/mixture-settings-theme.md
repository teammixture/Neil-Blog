We&#8217;re currently working on the GUI for the settings in MIxture and we started testing a new theme for the look and feel, here&#8217;s a couple of early screens&#8230;

If you haven&#8217;t seen or used Mixture then here&#8217;s one of the screens with the current theme&#8230;

The new theme would also increase the dimensions of the application, although we want to keep the application small as it&#8217;s important that Mixture feels lightweight and unobtrusive.

Love to get some feedback on this, maybe we should allow you to choose a theme?
