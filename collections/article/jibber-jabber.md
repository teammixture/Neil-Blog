On the 28th September I will be talking at [The Theory of (R)evolution](http://2012.shropgeek-revolution.co.uk/).

If you&#8217;re interested, I&#8217;m going to be talking about a few projects I&#8217;ve worked on.

As I&#8217;m currently based in Shropshire and the event is Shropshire based I will of course be talking about a local project [Shropshire Screen](http://shropshirescreen.co.uk). I&#8217;ll also be talking with [Mike Kus](http://twitter.com/mikekus) about [WorkFu](http://workfu.com) and our experiences (good and bad) and hopefully I&#8217;ll have the time to demonstrate Mixture.

If you&#8217;re going to the event make sure you say hello!
