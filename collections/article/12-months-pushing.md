The last 12 months have been interesting to say the least, I’m gutted that WorkFu didn’t work out quite as planned, but super pleased that the experience has led to a very exciting new project, here’s a brief history and a bit more info on what I’m doing next&#8230;

Around this time last year, the idea for [WorkFu](http://workfu.com) was born out of a small hack challenge between [Pete Nelson](http://twitter.com/petetak) and myself.

Very quickly we put together a rough proof of concept for some of the tech we had in mind and brought on [Mike Kus](http://twitter.com/mikekus) and [Adam Martin](http://twitter.com/adammmartin). I think we made a great team.

Working closely with Mike on ideas, implementing his design work and playing with interaction on the site has been a brilliant experience. Mike&#8217;s a truly talented guy and if you get the chance to work with him you should take it.

WorkFu has been an incredible amount of work including many late nights, but the experience has been invaluable, I&#8217;ve learnt more than I would ever have imagined. 

A couple of months ago it became obvious that WorkFu was growing into a very big idea and would require a lot more time and money to get it where it needs to be, as we had just spent the last 9 months working full-time and sacrificed paid jobs we decided that we were not in a position to take the project forward - this decision was not taken lightly, but we all have young families and we need to make sure they continue to eat.

A lot of lessons have been learnt during the WorkFu experience, Mike and myself recently talked at an [event](http://2012.shropgeek-revolution.co.uk/) and went through some of these.

Recently we announced that we are now in positive discussions regarding the future of WorkFu, this is very exciting as it means the site can live on and move forward as we had always intended. I&#8217;m pleased to say that we&#8217;ll still be involved in a smaller capacity. We will of course announce more on this as and when we can.

If I had to give any advice based on my experiences&#8230;

I&#8217;ve read many many articles about start-ups, start-up life and so on&#8230; too many, they start to melt your brain. Don&#8217;t try and live someone else&#8217;s experiences, just get started on your own.

Well thats enough about the Fu, what&#8217;s next&#8230;

Before starting WorkFu I had been playing with another idea which was shelved due to WorkFu, but following the decision to stop WorkFu I began thinking about this idea again. The idea is basically [Mixture](http://mixture.io) (you can see and read more about it in a [previous post](http://neilkinnish.com/post/31819131515)) a tool for rapid front-end development and prototyping.

What I love about this idea is that I have a genuine desire to use it and well&#8230; I am!

Pete, Mike and myself are involved and we&#8217;ve been working very hard over the last month or two to get the application (Mac + Windows) ready. We have a lot of work to do and some great ideas we are pumping into the project, but we’re now just about ready to start releasing the application for preview. 

I&#8217;m also super excited to say that we have secured investment for the project which means we can work full-time, fully focused without the fear of running out of time, money or being pulled into necessary client work.

I&#8217;m looking forward to the next 12 months&#8230;
