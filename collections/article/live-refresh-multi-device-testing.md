We are literally days away from releasing the public beta version of Mixture and we&#8217;ve added a feature that we&#8217;re pretty excited about.

When using Mixture to build a standard Mixture project you can already multi-device test with Mixture&#8217;s local server, it will even live refresh and style inject for you across pretty much every device or browser as soon as it detects a change.

We wanted to bring this feature to non-mixture projects and enable more users to experience what Mixture has to offer&#8230;

So, you can now run non-mixture projects in a mode we are calling &#8220;simple mode&#8221;, this for example means that you can now use Mixture with your Wordpress projects running on Mamp or Wamp and benefit from all of the above mentioned features.

Mixture will also takes care of preprocessing (Sass, Less, Stylus, CoffeeScript), minification (CSS, JS) and lots more.

This video shows a standard Wordpress install running on Mamp with Mixture&#8230;

Oh and that&#8217;s not all&#8230; We&#8217;ve integrated BrowserStack and you can use this with non-mixture projects - it will even live refresh BrowserStack when you make a change :)

Another cool feature&#8230; You can publish Mixture projects online to share, test or get sign-off, we&#8217;ve now added the ability to assign your own domain and host it publicly like this [http://frontenddesignconference.com](http://frontenddesignconference.com).

We&#8217;re currently working on the admin management for all of this. But, in the meantime you can do this simply by adding the domain to your project settings and publishing.

If you haven&#8217;t seen Mixture running at a device lab, [here&#8217;s the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER-la4wunyo).
