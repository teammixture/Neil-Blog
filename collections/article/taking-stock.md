We&#8217;ve been progressing very quickly with Mixture over the last few months, today I decided to stop, breathe and make a quick log of where Mixture is today and whats coming next.

It&#8217;s nice to write down our progress, we&#8217;ve come a very long way since the original alpha app we pushed a few months back.

###Today

* Windows + Mac support
* Builtin local server
* Dynamic template languages: Liquid &amp; HAML (allowing layouts, includes / partials and much more)
* Mixture specific template tags allowing on the fly lorem ipsum, placeholder images and asset finding.
* HTML parsing
* Automatic live reload and style injection
* Automatic Multi-device testing (including live reload and style injection)
* Preprocessing: Sass, Less, CoffeeScript, Stylus
* Compass integration (including support for frameworks + plugins)
* Concatenation support for CSS + JS files
* Minification support for CSS + JS files
* Script linting
* Image optimisation
* Smart to-dos
* Dynamic data models (local and online)
* One click publish (same url or new)
* Add a domain to a project, for super simple hosting of projects
* Export to static HTML
* Boilerplates, choose from a range (inuit.css, sassaprilla, foundation, bourbon, bootstrap and more)
* Boilerplates - popular, favourites, public &amp; private
* Integration of 3rd party services: BrowserStack
* Chrome extension: Sass, Less and Stylus debug tool
* Simple mode: Allowing mixture features to be used with another server (mamp, wamp, rails, etc) and type of project
* Recent projects
* Online account management
* Retina ready (Mac)

###What we built to get here

* Windows application (alpha &amp; beta version)
* Mac application (alpha &amp; beta version)
* The Mixture API (currently private)
* Online service and infrastructure for published projects (although we say static Mixture published projects are actually pretty dynamic).
* The Docs (Mixture project)
* The Mixture site (Mixture project)
* Various screencasts and demo projects
* Support site

###Tomorrow (and beyond)

* Pricing, we&#8217;re announcing our pricing options very soon.
* Powerful &#8220;collection&#8221; feature (allowing multiple blogs, portfolios, etc - great for live projects or prototyping and it supports Haml, Liquid &amp; Markdown) ** excited about this one, it&#8217;s an interesting implementation
* Online admin completion, allowing full management of account, 3rd party services, published projects and boilerplates
* Create / Manage private and public boilerplates. Share and promote. Usage statistics.
* Simple collaboration features.
* Manage published projects: remove, private or password protect.
* Mixture profile page
* Custom profile page (any published project = your profile)
* Potential support for the template languages Jade &amp; Slim
* Markdown support
* Lots of additional 3rd party integrations, we&#8217;re working on some very cool integrations and options for Mixture projects (more on these soon)
* Update the support site to improve the management and visibility of information.

We&#8217;ve seen some amazing use cases for Mixture, had some awesome projects bult with it and thousands of projects have already been published.

Love to hear any thoughts or suggestions.
