Over the last few months we have been actively building [Mixture](http://mixture.io) for the Mac &amp; Windows platforms - it has always been our aim to support both.

However, over the last couple of months while previewing the application, we&#8217;ve begun to question the appetite for tools like Mixture on the Windows platform and this may explain why many popular front-end tools do not exist for Windows.

We&#8217;ve long believed that the majority of front-end development happens on the Mac and this last few months has only confirmed that.

Rather than simply assuming this to be the case, we thought we should ask the community.
