Over the last few weeks people have been asking about the pricing and release schedule for [Mixture](http://mixture.io).

We&#8217;re currently working very hard to get everything in place so as we can release the public beta of Mixture late Feb / early Match. Whilst in beta Mixture will be free to use as we build out the application and online services.

Once the beta period is over we will introduce our plans &amp; pricing. We&#8217;ve had a lot of discussions around this and it&#8217;s been one of the hardest parts of the process.

We&#8217;ve gone through many iterations of pricing, but felt it was getting a little complex. We need to keep it super simple, so here&#8217;s our thinking&#8230;

###Free &amp; Pro.

This is how they currently breakdown&#8230;

_Free plan:_

1. The application (mac or windows).
2. Online profile with your unique address.
3. Access to the popular project boilerplates.
4. Unlimited publish / host sites online (1 month trial).

_Pro ($15 a month):_

1. The application (mac or windows).
2. Online profile with your unique address.
3. Boilerplates, popular, favourites, create and share or private.
4. Unlimited publish / host sites online (additional options, private &amp; password protected).
5. Give access for multiple users to publish or download a site.
6. Versioning - basic versioning exists on every publish, a pro account will give you access to these versions (this is not source control and you should continue to use Git, Mercurial etc).
7. Access to client sign-off tools.
8. Improved support.
9. Custom domain for your account.
10. Convert to HTML.

_Pro (additional options)_:

1. Custom domain per project / website (small yearly cost to be confirmed). We have lots more coming to the pro plan, but it&#8217;s a little early to detail.

We&#8217;re keen to get feedback on the plans and proposed pricing so if you have any thoughts or feelings then please let us know - from the start we decided that we wanted to be as transparent as possible with our pricing, user statistics and journey, so we&#8217;ll be writing about our experiences as we progress.

We will of course need to review the viability of releasing the application for free and this will be affected by the response to the pro plan, this is important as we need to make sure we can support the services and associated ongoing costs.

A big thank you to everyone who has and is participating with the current alpha, your feedback has been invaluable and really is appreciated.

PS. We are currently working on a dedicated Mixture blog and will be rolling this out very soon.
