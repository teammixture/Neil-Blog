Over the last few months we&#8217;ve been working incredibly hard to get [Mixture](http://mixture.io) up to a level that we could start previewing with a small group of users, take feedback, bug fix and move forward.

If you&#8217;ve signed up for access, rest assured will be inviting you **very** soon to download and start playing with [Mixture](http://mixture.io) :)

If you can&#8217;t wait and wish to offer feedback, tell us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/teammixture) and we will try and give you access now.

We&#8217;re now getting ready to move to the next stage and thought it was time to detail and preview what&#8217;s coming next.

Early January 2013 we are planning to move from the current preview (alpha) and into beta. At this point all registered users will be invited to start using Mixture and it&#8217;s services.

We will also announce details of our pricing and plans but while in beta the application and services will remain completely free.

Very soon we will roll out Mixture profiles and all of the goodness that these bring. When you create an account with Mixture we give you a unique address based upon your username (eg [http://neil.mixture.io](http://neil.mixture.io)), when you publish a project Mixture will give you a url for that project based upon this address.

Your profile page will look a little something like this&#8230;

We will release more information about all the features coming very soon.

Our aim is to not only make a great tool, but also make it super easy for you to create, push and share projects. This could be just to get feedback or because you need client sign-off also Mixture makes it very quick and easy to develop and prototype large working projects, sites or even small experiments and promotions.

If you haven&#8217;t already seen it [The Industry](http://theindustry.cc/) wrote a great [article about Mixture](http://theindustry.cc/2012/12/03/mixture-the-web-developers-life-just-got-easier/).

I&#8217;ll leave you with a rough and ready video that showcases a feature we&#8217;ve been working on to aid multi-device testing with Mixture.

The video shows the windows version of Mixture running on a project, with the following devices / browsers connected via a local ip address&#8230;

1. IE 9 on Windows
2. Firefox on Windows
3. Chrome on Windows
4. Chrome on Mac 
5. iPad
6. iPhone

Mixture live refreshes all machines on a change to the project files or when navigating on any of the devices all machines will follow and navigate to the same page (you may want to change the quality settings of the video before playing).
