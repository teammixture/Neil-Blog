This will report as a 301 Moved Permanently.</p>\n\n<h3>Custom Ruby</h3>\n\n<p>You can now point Mixture at your own install of Ruby and Gems, this is useful if you want an easy way to use plugins with Compass or if you with to use an alpha version of Compass not supported by Mixture.</p>\n\n<p>There has of course also been many more small updates and improvements, you can view the change logs <a href=\"http://docs.mixture.io/mac/changelog\">Mac</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://docs.mixture.io/windows/changelog\">Windows</a></p>\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested, I&#8217;m tweeting small bite-size Mixture tips on a regular basis, focused on individual features of Mixture and the tech involved.

It&#8217;s worth noting that some of this may be resolved in the future with SVG <a href=\"http://www.broken-links.com/2012/08/14/better-svg-sprites-with-fragment-identifiers/\">fragments</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Not every browser <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#search=svg\">supports SVG</a> and some that do may not handle them as expected. The project had a requirement for some icons to scale with the browser window, but maintain ratio - IE9 had an issue with this.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the approach we took&#8230;</p>\n\n<h3>SVG compression</h3>\n\n<p>We created our SVGs with illustrator and then compressed them with <a href=\"https://github.com/svg/svgo\">svgo</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>HTTP requests and spriting</h3>\n\n<p>To resolve the issue of additional HTTP requests and lack of spriting, we Base64 encoded and embedded many of the SVGs into our stylesheet (it&#8217;s advisable to use gzip also).</p>\n\n<p>Creating Base64 data urls can be a slow and painful task. You can automate this task, but if thats not possible for you to setup and implement I created a small online <a href=\"http://neil.mixture.io/non\">Base64 tool</a> to make this process quicker and easier. You simply drag and drop your images or even a directory of images, and it will spit out a style sheet with the necessary embedded images - it&#8217;s pretty quick and I found it super useful.</p>\n\n<h3>Fallback / Browser support</h3>\n\n<p>We used the javascript from <a href=\"https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon\">grunticon</a> to serve our SVG styles to supporting browsers with a fallback to PNG for non supporting browsers. </p>\n\n<p>For non-SVG browsers we only created standard PNGs (sprites where possible) no need to create retina versions.</p>\n\n<h3>Scaling &amp; Maintaing ratio</h3>\n\n<p>To solve the issue we had with some browsers failing to scale and maintain ratio on SVGs, we created small transparent GIFs sized correctly and then applied the SVG image to the background of this image - this solved our issue.</p>\n\n<h3>Tooling / Workflow</h3>\n\n<p>Of course, I used <a href=\"http://mixture.io\">Mixture</a> to build and develop the project, this allowed me to test live on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER-la4wunyo\">multiple devices / browsers</a> and keep Mike in the loop.</p>\n\n<p>The ability to publish quickly online offers many benefits, in this case it allowed us to discuss and make changes to the design and build efficiently.</p>\n\n<p>I chose <a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\">Sass</a> as the preprocessor and took a mobile-first approach. Here&#8217;s a quick summary of my setup&#8230;</p>\n\n<p>1 A base stylesheet which all browsers will load\n2. A layout stylesheet which contains all of the media query breakpoints (all breakpoint styles are separated into partials). This is only loaded by browsers that support media queries.\n3. IE8 (and down) stylesheet which is conditionally loaded, this stylesheet loads all necessary breakpoint partials (with out the media query logic) and has a sprinkle of IE specific styles. This gives just a desktop view for these browsers and I specifically set a minimum width.\n4 As mentioned the loading of SVG or PNG stylesheets is handled by javascript with <a href=\"https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon\">Grunticon</a>.\n5. Mixture took care of the preprocessing, minifcation and combination for all stylesheets and javascript files. We are serving with gzip compression.</p>\n\n<p>Using Mixtures <a href=\"http://docs.mixture.io/templates\">templating</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.mixture.io/models\">models</a> I was able to structure my site using layouts and includes and use real data to build against. Here&#8217;s a few reasons why I think this is really powerful</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Using real data I could kept my templates even more lightweight and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don\">DRY</a>, no need to add lots of dummy markup. Create once and populate with real data.</li>\n  <li>Real data allowed me to test and better understand how our styles and markup reacted to real data, so often this is not considered and can cause problems during content population.</li>\n  <li>As I had data I was also able to write ajax functions to use this data and create all necessary features for the site.</li>\n  <li>The backend developer used my models as a reference for the data needed (meaning they didn&#8217;t have to touch the markup). Of course I could have also been supplied the real data as JSON files upfront and built against them.</li>\n  <li>Modelling the data as you build the front-end allows you to think more about what you are implementing and potential issues can be resolved during the front-end build.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Summary of tools</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"http://neil.mixture.io/non\">Base64 tool</a></li>\n  <li>SVG compression with <a href=\"https://github.com/svg/svgo\">svgo</a> *</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon\">Grunticon</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://mixture.io\">Mixture</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Useful resources</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Harry Roberts (csswizardry) blogged <a href=\"http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/front-end-performance-for-web-designers-and-front-end-developers/\">Front-end performance</a>.</li>\n  <li>David Bushell has a nice <a href=\"http://dbushell.com/2013/02/04/a-primer-to-front-end-svg-hacking/\">write up about SVG</a>.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#search=svg\">http://caniuse.com/#search=svg</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Finally</h3>\n\n<p>I mentioned in a previous post that I was making some screencasts for <a href=\"http://mixture.io\">Mixture</a> - Apologies for the delay, I decided to use the Future Insights build to create the screencasts.

Usually thats because the project they are building is simply static HTML files.</p>\n\n<p>Although it&#8217;s pretty straight forward to convert a project into a Mixture project, we thought we could make it easier to run these types of projects in Mixture.</p>\n\n<p>So as of today and the latest update&#8230;</p>\n\n<p>If you use Mixture in simple mode and <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> set a partner server, Mixture will boot a lightweight version of its own server. This server will parse HTML files and assets, it will even add live refresh, style injection and multi-device ability automatically!</p>\n\n<p>As an example, if in the root of your project directory you had a file called &#8220;about.html&#8221; you could simply &#8220;view locally&#8221; on Mixture and then go to the url &#8220;/about&#8221; to view that page.

I think we made a great team.</p>\n<p>Working closely with Mike on ideas, implementing his design work and playing with interaction on the site has been a brilliant experience. Mike&#8217;s a truly talented guy and if you get the chance to work with him you should take it.</p>\n<p>WorkFu has been an incredible amount of work including many late nights, but the experience has been invaluable, I&#8217;ve learnt more than I would ever have imagined. </p>\n<p>A couple of months ago it became obvious that WorkFu was growing into a very big idea and would require a lot more time and money to get it where it needs to be, as we had just spent the last 9 months working full-time and sacrificed paid jobs we decided that we were not in a position to take the project forward - this decision was not taken lightly, but we all have young families and we need to make sure they continue to eat.</p>\n<p>A lot of lessons have been learnt during the WorkFu experience, Mike and myself recently talked at an <a href=\"http://2012.shropgeek-revolution.co.uk/\">event</a> and went through some of these.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/shropshire+talk.jpg\" alt=\"Shropshire talk\"></p>\n<p>Recently we announced that we are now in positive discussions regarding the future of WorkFu, this is very exciting as it means the site can live on and move forward as we had always intended.

We will of course announce more on this as and when we can.</p>\n<p>Well thats enough about the Fu, what&#8217;s next&#8230;</p>\n<p>Before starting WorkFu I had been playing with another idea which was shelved due to WorkFu, but following the decision to stop WorkFu I began thinking about this idea again. The idea is basically <a href=\"http://mixture.io\">Mixture</a> (you can see and read more about it in a <a href=\"http://neilkinnish.com/post/31819131515\">previous post</a>) a tool for rapid front-end development and prototyping.</p>\n<p>What I love about this idea is that I have a genuine desire to use it and well&#8230; I am!</p>\n<p>Pete, Mike and myself are involved and we&#8217;ve been working very hard over the last month or two to get the application (Mac + Windows) ready.
